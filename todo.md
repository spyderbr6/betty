## 💳 STRIPE INTEGRATION STATUS

### ✅ Completed (this session)
- **Card deposits via Stripe Payment Sheet** — replaces manual Venmo TX ID entry
  - `stripe-payment-intent` Lambda creates PaymentIntent, returns clientSecret
  - `AddFundsModal` replaced with 2-step Stripe flow (amount → Payment Sheet → success)
  - 0.5% processing fee shown transparently before payment; waived for Pro members
- **Stripe webhook** Lambda updates Transaction + credits balance automatically
  - Exposed via Lambda Function URL (copy URL from CloudFormation outputs → Stripe Dashboard → Developers → Webhooks)
  - Handles: `payment_intent.succeeded`, `customer.subscription.*`
- **Pro subscription** ($4.99/month) via Stripe Billing
  - `stripe-manage` Lambda: creates subscription, returns clientSecret for Payment Sheet
  - Customer Portal via `createStripeManage({ action: 'customer_portal' })` — no custom cancel UI needed
  - Webhook handles subscription lifecycle (created, updated, deleted → User.subscriptionTier)
- **Fee restructure** — all rates centralized in `src/config/subscriptionConfig.ts`
  - Free tier: 0.5% deposit, 2% withdrawal, 3% winnings
  - Pro tier: 0% on everything
- **AdminTestingScreen** gated behind `__DEV__` (removed from production builds)

### ⚙️ Required setup before deploying
1. Create Stripe account at stripe.com
2. Copy Secret Key → set `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` in Amplify environment variables
3. Copy Publishable Key → add `STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_live_...` to `.env` file
4. Create Pro subscription product in Stripe → copy Price ID → set `STRIPE_PRO_PRICE_ID` in Amplify env vars
5. Run `npx expo install @stripe/stripe-react-native`
6. Deploy Amplify backend (`amplify push`) — CloudFormation outputs will show `StripeWebhookUrl`
7. In Stripe Dashboard → Developers → Webhooks → Add endpoint → paste `StripeWebhookUrl`
8. Copy Webhook Signing Secret → set `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` in Amplify environment variables
9. Enable Customer Portal in Stripe Dashboard → Settings → Billing → Customer Portal

### 🔮 Phase 2: Automated Withdrawals (Stripe Connect Express)
**Goal**: Eliminate the remaining manual admin step for paying out withdrawals.

**How it works:**
1. User taps "Withdraw" — they're prompted to connect their bank via Stripe Connect Express onboarding
2. One-time onboarding: user enters bank account info, Stripe verifies identity (KYC)
3. After onboarding, `User.stripeConnectedAccountId` is stored in DynamoDB
4. On withdrawal request: platform calls `stripe.transfers.create()` → funds hit user's bank in 1-2 days

**Implementation steps:**
1. Add `stripeConnectedAccountId` field to User model in `amplify/data/resource.ts`
2. Create `stripe-connect-onboard` Lambda: calls `stripe.accountLinks.create()` with type `account_onboarding`, returns onboarding URL
3. Add new GraphQL mutation `createStripeConnectOnboardingLink` → backed by Lambda
4. In `WithdrawFundsModal`: check if user has `stripeConnectedAccountId`
   - If not: show "Connect Your Bank" button → open onboarding URL (Linking.openURL)
   - If yes: show standard withdrawal flow
5. Handle `account.updated` webhook event → update `stripeConnectedAccountId` when onboarding completes
6. Create `stripe-payout` Lambda: calls `stripe.transfers.create({ destination: connectedAccountId, amount, currency: 'usd' })`
7. Replace admin approval queue for withdrawals with automatic payout trigger
8. Withdrawal then completes in 1-2 business days with no admin involvement

**Cost**: Stripe charges 0.25% per payout (capped at $2) — already covered by the 2% withdrawal fee for Free tier. Pro members pay 0% withdrawal fee but the platform still pays Stripe's ~0.25%.

## 🔧 DEVELOPMENT SETUP

### **Key Commands**
```bash
npm start              # Start Expo development server
npm run android        # Run on Android device/emulator
npm run ios            # Run on iOS simulator
npm run typecheck      # Run TypeScript type checking
npx amplify push       # Deploy backend changes
npx amplify codegen    # Generate GraphQL types
```

### **Troubleshooting: Expo/Metro Not Starting**

If Expo or Metro bundler won't start or shows port conflicts, use these commands:

**Windows:**
```bash
# Find and kill processes on port 8081 (Metro bundler)
netstat -ano | findstr :8081
taskkill /PID <PID> /F

# Kill all Node processes
taskkill /F /IM node.exe

# Kill all Java processes (Android emulator/Gradle)
taskkill /F /IM java.exe

# Kill all Expo processes
taskkill /F /IM expo.exe

# Clear Metro cache and restart
npx expo start --clear
```

**macOS/Linux:**
```bash
# Find and kill processes on port 8081
lsof -ti:8081 | xargs kill -9

# Kill all Node processes
pkill -9 node

# Kill all Java processes
pkill -9 java

# Clear Metro cache and restart
npx expo start --clear
```

**Full Reset Procedure:**
```bash
# 1. Kill all processes
taskkill /F /IM node.exe
taskkill /F /IM java.exe

# 2. Clear all caches
npx expo start --clear

# 3. If still having issues, clear npm cache
npm cache clean --force

# 4. Delete node_modules and reinstall (last resort)
rm -rf node_modules
npm install
```

**Common Issues:**
- **Port 8081 in use**: Kill node.exe processes
- **Android emulator stuck**: Kill java.exe processes
- **Metro bundler cache issues**: Use `--clear` flag
- **TypeScript errors persisting**: Run `npx amplify codegen` to regenerate types

### **Current Development Status**
- **Main Branch**: `main` (stable, full account system complete)
- **Latest Features**: Account menu system, bet invitations, modal standards
- **Status**: Production-ready MVP with complete feature set

## 📈 RECENT MILESTONES

- ✅ **Comprehensive Notification System** (Latest - 2025-10-26)
  - **Notification Preferences System:**
    - Database schema for user preferences (NotificationPreferences model)
    - Complete preference service with CRUD operations
    - Settings screen with real-time database persistence
    - Master controls (push, in-app, email)
    - 8 granular notification type filters (friends, bets, payments, system)
    - Do Not Disturb scheduling with time windows
    - All preferences default to enabled for good UX
  - **Intelligent Toast Notification System:**
    - Smart batching: 3+ same-type notifications → single batch toast
    - Rate limiting: Max 1 toast per 3 seconds to prevent spam
    - Queue overflow protection: 5+ notifications → batch message
    - Priority-based display: URGENT (red, 5s) > HIGH (green, 4s) > MEDIUM (blue, 3s)
