## üîÑ IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS (Current Development Cycle)

### **Priority 1: Critical Bug Fixes & UI Polish** ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- [ ] Fix this issue. 9:20:01 PM [WARNING] aws-cdk-lib.aws_lambda.FunctionOptions#logRetention is deprecated.
  use `logGroup` instead
  This API will be removed in the next major release.
- [ ] extend upcoming game window for live event picker to 48 hours instead of 24. 
- [ ] when checked into an event, the create bet options should reflect the teams within the event you're checked into. 
- [ ] bet types. remove weather and entertainment. lets add an over/under type bet, which will need the creator to enter a value for bettors to pick an over or an under. it needs to remain as simple and quick as possible
- [ ] on live bets, friends and all tab buttons need to be slightly taller to be easier for mobile users. 
- [ ] check into this warning. 12:44:09 PM Be careful when using @auth directives on a field in a root type. @auth directives on field definitions use the source object to perform authorization logic and the source will be an empty object for fields on root types. Static group authorization should perform as expected.
- [ ] check into this warning. 12:44:11 PM WARNING: owners may reassign ownership for the following model(s) and role(s): User: [owner], PushToken: [owner], Bet: [owner], Participant: [owner], Evidence: [owner], UserStats: [owner], FriendRequest: [owner], Friendship: [owner], BetInvitation: [owner], PaymentMethod: [owner], Transaction: [owner], EventCheckIn: [owner]. If this is not intentional, you may want to apply field-level authorization rules to these fields. To read more: https://docs.amplify.aws/cli/graphql/authorization-rules/#per-user--owner-based-data-access.

## üîß DEVELOPMENT SETUP

### **Key Commands**
```bash
npm start              # Start Expo development server
npm run android        # Run on Android device/emulator
npm run ios            # Run on iOS simulator
npm run typecheck      # Run TypeScript type checking
npx amplify push       # Deploy backend changes
npx amplify codegen    # Generate GraphQL types
```

### **Troubleshooting: Expo/Metro Not Starting**

If Expo or Metro bundler won't start or shows port conflicts, use these commands:

**Windows:**
```bash
# Find and kill processes on port 8081 (Metro bundler)
netstat -ano | findstr :8081
taskkill /PID <PID> /F

# Kill all Node processes
taskkill /F /IM node.exe

# Kill all Java processes (Android emulator/Gradle)
taskkill /F /IM java.exe

# Kill all Expo processes
taskkill /F /IM expo.exe

# Clear Metro cache and restart
npx expo start --clear
```

**macOS/Linux:**
```bash
# Find and kill processes on port 8081
lsof -ti:8081 | xargs kill -9

# Kill all Node processes
pkill -9 node

# Kill all Java processes
pkill -9 java

# Clear Metro cache and restart
npx expo start --clear
```

**Full Reset Procedure:**
```bash
# 1. Kill all processes
taskkill /F /IM node.exe
taskkill /F /IM java.exe

# 2. Clear all caches
npx expo start --clear

# 3. If still having issues, clear npm cache
npm cache clean --force

# 4. Delete node_modules and reinstall (last resort)
rm -rf node_modules
npm install
```

**Common Issues:**
- **Port 8081 in use**: Kill node.exe processes
- **Android emulator stuck**: Kill java.exe processes
- **Metro bundler cache issues**: Use `--clear` flag
- **TypeScript errors persisting**: Run `npx amplify codegen` to regenerate types

### **Current Development Status**
- **Main Branch**: `main` (stable, full account system complete)
- **Latest Features**: Account menu system, bet invitations, modal standards
- **Status**: Production-ready MVP with complete feature set
