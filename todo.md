- Real-time subscriptions for live updates
```

## ✅ MVP COMPLETION + POLISH - SEPTEMBER 2025

### 🎉 ALL CORE MVP FEATURES + POLISH COMPLETED!

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED - Full betting MVP with real-time functionality + all small fixes

**Completed Work**:
- ✅ Connected CreateBetScreen to Amplify GraphQL API with real bet creation
- ✅ Implemented bet joining functionality in BetCard with participant creation

- ✅ **NEW:** Real-time participant count updates when users join bets

**Files Enhanced**:
- ✅ `src/screens/CreateBetScreen.tsx` - Real balance + improved formatting
- ✅ `src/components/betting/BetCard.tsx` - Real bet amounts + join feedback
- ✅ `src/screens/BetsScreen.tsx` - Scrolling + user filtering + real-time participants
- ✅ `src/screens/AccountScreen.tsx` - Real user data integration
- ✅ `amplify/data/resource.ts` - Added betAmount field to schema

**Complete MVP User Flow**:
1. **Register/Login** → User authentication with Cognito
2. **Create Bet** → Real bet stored with proper amounts and formatting
3. **Browse My Bets** → Real-time updates of user's specific bets with scrolling
4. **Join Bet** → Uses actual bet amounts with visual feedback
5. **View Stats** → Real user statistics and live balance tracking
6. **Sign Out** → Secure session termination

## 🚧 NEXT PHASE - ENHANCED FEATURES (Medium Priority)

### 1. MyBetsScreen Enhancements
**Status**: PENDING - Screen exists but needs filtering for user's bets

**Remaining Work**:
- Filter bets where user is creator or participant
- Add bet status filtering (active, completed, etc.)
- Show user's position and potential payouts

### 2. Bet Resolution System ✅ COMPLETED
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED - Core betting lifecycle now complete

**Completed Work**:
- ✅ Implemented comprehensive bet resolution workflow
- ✅ Built ResolveScreen with bet creator resolution interface
- ✅ Added payout calculation and distribution logic
- ✅ Implemented user balance deduction when joining bets
- ✅ Automatic balance updates and payout distribution when bets resolve
- ✅ User stats tracking (total bets, win rate, total winnings)
- ✅ Real-time subscriptions for bet resolution updates
- ✅ Balance validation before joining bets

**Files Enhanced**:
- ✅ `src/screens/ResolveScreen.tsx` - Complete bet resolution interface
- ✅ `src/components/betting/BetCard.tsx` - Balance validation and deduction on join
- ✅ Real user balance integration throughout the app

### 3. Enhanced Real-time Features
**Status**: PENDING - Build on existing subscriptions

**Remaining Work**:
- Real-time participant count updates
- Live bet activity notifications
- Instant balance updates after payouts

## 🔮 FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS (Lower Priority)

### 4. Small enhancements
- wire up or remove the filters from the live bet page.
- implement status filters on the my bets page
- resolution management should be by vote for all the participants as we have no real way to verify the winner. we need a way to deal with using the user trust metric here as well as updating the trust metric based on the result of the finalized voting.
- the user balance needs to be like a standalone component that each screen is calling or move it into the header directly so we can ensure its always up to date. 
- 

### 5. Friend and Friend Management
  - work with each other on the scope


### 5. Location Services Integration
- Location-based bet discovery
- Verify bet locations for local events
- **Dependencies**: `expo-location`

## 🔮 Backlog ENHANCEMENTS (Lowest Priority)

### 4. QR Code Functionality
- Add QR code generation for bet sharing
- QR code scanning to join bets quickly
- **Dependencies**: `expo-camera`, `expo-barcode-scanner`

### 6. Camera Integration for Evidence
- Photo evidence for bet resolution
- Image upload to AWS S3
- **Dependencies**: `expo-camera`, `expo-image-picker`

### 7. Advanced Trust Scoring System
- Reputation tracking
- Bet resolution verification
- Social trust metrics

## 🛠️ Technical Debt & Improvements

### Code Quality
- Add TypeScript strict mode
- Implement error boundaries
- Add unit tests for core functionality
- Set up ESLint/Prettier configuration

### Performance
- Implement FlatList virtualization for large bet lists
- Add image optimization and caching
- Optimize GraphQL queries with fragments

### Security
