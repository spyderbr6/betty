## 🔄 IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS (Current Development Cycle)

### **Priority 1: Critical Bug Fixes & UI Polish**
- [ ] Fix invitation accepted notifications showing userID instead of friendly display name. do a quick scan on other notifications to ensure they're all fixed. 
- [ ] Fix notification bell counter showing incorrect count (showing 16 for 6 notifications, 6 for 3, etc.)
- [ ] Remove ellipsis (...) from header and move notification bell to the right
- [ ] Restructure betting history screen as balance audit trail
  - Show all balance changes (bets, wins, losses, deposits, withdrawals)
  - More streamlined accounting-style UI
  - Full balance reconciliation capability
- [ ] Need a quick join capability. maybe with qr codes, qr code can show on the 'invite to bet' screen and we need an equally easy ability on maybe the live bets screen to pull up the camera to read a qr code which will create an invite for whoever scans it.

### **Priority 2: Account Screen Enhancements**
- [ ] Wire up Payment Methods screen to actual payment integration
- [ ] Implement Trust & Safety features
  - Change password functionality

### **Priority 3: Feature Completion**
- [ ] Remove or implement private bet functionality
  - Currently toggle exists but does nothing
  - Either wire up private bet logic or remove the option
- [ ] Enhanced push notifications with expo-notifications
- [ ] Instant balance updates after payouts and joins
- [ ] Real-time notification delivery improvements

## 🔧 DEVELOPMENT SETUP

### **Key Commands**
```bash
npm start              # Start Expo development server
npm run android        # Run on Android device/emulator
npm run ios            # Run on iOS simulator
npm run typecheck      # Run TypeScript type checking
npx amplify push       # Deploy backend changes
npx amplify codegen    # Generate GraphQL types
```

### **Troubleshooting: Expo/Metro Not Starting**

If Expo or Metro bundler won't start or shows port conflicts, use these commands:

**Windows:**
```bash
# Find and kill processes on port 8081 (Metro bundler)
netstat -ano | findstr :8081
taskkill /PID <PID> /F

# Kill all Node processes
taskkill /F /IM node.exe

# Kill all Java processes (Android emulator/Gradle)
taskkill /F /IM java.exe

# Kill all Expo processes
taskkill /F /IM expo.exe

# Clear Metro cache and restart
npx expo start --clear
```

**macOS/Linux:**
```bash
# Find and kill processes on port 8081
lsof -ti:8081 | xargs kill -9

# Kill all Node processes
pkill -9 node

# Kill all Java processes
pkill -9 java

# Clear Metro cache and restart
npx expo start --clear
```

**Full Reset Procedure:**
```bash
# 1. Kill all processes
taskkill /F /IM node.exe
taskkill /F /IM java.exe

# 2. Clear all caches
npx expo start --clear

# 3. If still having issues, clear npm cache
npm cache clean --force

# 4. Delete node_modules and reinstall (last resort)
rm -rf node_modules
npm install
```

**Common Issues:**
- **Port 8081 in use**: Kill node.exe processes
- **Android emulator stuck**: Kill java.exe processes
- **Metro bundler cache issues**: Use `--clear` flag
- **TypeScript errors persisting**: Run `npx amplify codegen` to regenerate types

### **Current Development Status**
- **Main Branch**: `main` (stable, full account system complete)
- **Latest Features**: Account menu system, bet invitations, modal standards
- **Status**: Production-ready MVP with complete feature set
