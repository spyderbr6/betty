# SideBet Todo List - Project Status & Next Steps

## Project Overview
SideBet is a React Native betting app built with Expo and AWS Amplify. The app allows users to create and join peer-to-peer bets with trust scoring and social features.

## Current Status ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Project renamed from Betty to SideBet
- [x] Amplify data schema updated for betting system
- [x] Professional design system implemented (colors, typography)
- [x] Directory structure created with proper organization
- [x] Core betting components built (BetCard, BetList)
- [x] Bottom navigation with 5 tabs implemented
- [x] Android build tested and running successfully

## Backend Schema (Amplify)
```typescript
// amplify/data/resource.ts contains:
- Bet model (id, title, description, amount, category, status, etc.)
- User model integration
- GraphQL API endpoints
- Real-time subscriptions for live updates
```

## 🚧 IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS (High Priority)

### 1. Complete MVP Betting Functionality
**Status**: IN PROGRESS - Core components built, needs integration

**Remaining Work**:
- Connect CreateBet component to Amplify GraphQL API
- Implement bet joining functionality in BetCard
- Add real-time updates using GraphQL subscriptions
- Test create → join → resolve bet flow

**Files to Modify**:
- `src/components/betting/CreateBet.tsx` - Add GraphQL mutations
- `src/components/betting/BetCard.tsx` - Add join/leave actions
- `src/screens/HomeScreen.tsx` - Add real-time bet feed
- `src/screens/MyBetsScreen.tsx` - Filter user's bets

### 2. Implement User Stats Panel
**Status**: PENDING - AccountScreen has mock data, needs real integration

**Remaining Work**:
- Connect AccountScreen to real user data
- Calculate win rate from completed bets
- Implement trust score algorithm
- Add betting history queries

**Files to Modify**:
- `src/screens/AccountScreen.tsx` - Replace mock data with GraphQL queries
- Add stats calculation utilities
- Update Amplify schema for user stats tracking

### 3. Add Sign Out Functionality
**Status**: PENDING - UI exists but not connected

**Remaining Work**:
- Connect sign out button in AccountScreen to AuthContext
- Test authentication flow

**Files to Modify**:
- `src/screens/AccountScreen.tsx` - Connect signOut function

## 🔮 FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS (Lower Priority)

### 4. QR Code Functionality
- Add QR code generation for bet sharing
- QR code scanning to join bets quickly
- **Dependencies**: `expo-camera`, `expo-barcode-scanner`

### 5. Location Services Integration
- Location-based bet discovery
- Verify bet locations for local events
- **Dependencies**: `expo-location`

### 6. Camera Integration for Evidence
- Photo evidence for bet resolution
- Image upload to AWS S3
- **Dependencies**: `expo-camera`, `expo-image-picker`

### 7. Advanced Trust Scoring System
- Reputation tracking
- Bet resolution verification
- Social trust metrics

## 🛠️ Technical Debt & Improvements

### Code Quality
- Add TypeScript strict mode
- Implement error boundaries
- Add unit tests for core functionality
- Set up ESLint/Prettier configuration

### Performance
- Implement FlatList virtualization for large bet lists
- Add image optimization and caching
- Optimize GraphQL queries with fragments

### Security
- Input validation on all forms
- Rate limiting for bet creation
- Secure file uploads

## 🚀 Deployment Preparation

### Android
- Update app.json with proper metadata
- Configure splash screen and app icons
- Set up EAS Build for Play Store
- Test on physical Android devices

### iOS (Future)
- Configure iOS-specific settings
- Test on iOS simulator/device
- Prepare for App Store submission

## 📱 Testing Checklist

### Core Functionality
- [ ] User registration and login
- [ ] Create new bet
- [ ] Join existing bet
- [ ] View bet details
- [ ] User profile and stats
- [ ] Navigation between screens

### Edge Cases
- [ ] Network connectivity issues
- [ ] Invalid bet data
- [ ] Concurrent bet joining
- [ ] User permission errors

## 🔧 Development Commands

```bash
# Start development
npm start

# Run on Android
npm run android

# Run on iOS (future)
npm run ios

# Deploy backend changes
npx amplify push

# Generate GraphQL types
npx amplify codegen
```

## 📝 Key Design Decisions Made

1. **Native UI Over Web Components**: Full React Native implementation for better mobile performance
2. **AWS Amplify Gen2**: Modern serverless backend with GraphQL API
3. **Bottom Tab Navigation**: Industry-standard mobile navigation pattern
4. **Professional Color Scheme**: Dark theme with blue accents for betting app aesthetic
5. **Component-Based Architecture**: Reusable components for scalability

## 🐛 Known Issues to Address

1. **Mock Data**: Several screens still use mock data instead of real GraphQL queries
2. **Error Handling**: Need comprehensive error handling throughout app
3. **Loading States**: Some screens need loading indicators
4. **Form Validation**: Add comprehensive form validation
5. **Offline Support**: Consider offline-first functionality

## 💡 Success Metrics to Track

- User engagement (daily active users)
- Bet completion rate
- Trust score accuracy
- App store ratings
- Revenue per user (if monetized)

## 📞 Next Session Action Plan

1. **Start Here**: Complete MVP betting functionality by connecting CreateBet to Amplify API
2. **Then**: Add real-time bet feed with GraphQL subscriptions
3. **Finally**: Connect AccountScreen to real user stats

**Estimated Time**: 2-3 hours for core MVP completion
**Priority**: High - This completes the minimum viable product
