## Backend Schema (Amplify)
```typescript
// amplify/data/resource.ts contains:
- Bet model (id, title, description, amount, category, status, etc.)
- User model integration
- GraphQL API endpoints
- Real-time subscriptions for live updates
```

## ✅ MVP COMPLETION - JANUARY 2025

### 🎉 ALL CORE MVP FEATURES COMPLETED!

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED - Full betting MVP with real-time functionality

**Completed Work**:
- ✅ Connected CreateBetScreen to Amplify GraphQL API with real bet creation
- ✅ Implemented bet joining functionality in BetCard with participant creation
- ✅ Added real-time bet feed using GraphQL subscriptions (`observeQuery`)
- ✅ Connected AccountScreen to real user stats with auto-creation for new users
- ✅ Added sign out functionality with confirmation dialog
- ✅ All TypeScript errors resolved with proper type safety

**Files Modified**:
- ✅ `src/screens/CreateBetScreen.tsx` - Full GraphQL integration with loading states
- ✅ `src/components/betting/BetCard.tsx` - Interactive betting with participant creation
- ✅ `src/screens/BetsScreen.tsx` - Real-time subscription feed with data transformation
- ✅ `src/screens/AccountScreen.tsx` - Real user data, stats, and sign out functionality

**MVP User Flow Now Complete**:
1. **Register/Login** → User authentication with Cognito
2. **Create Bet** → Real bet stored in DynamoDB via GraphQL
3. **Browse Feed** → Real-time updates of active bets
4. **Join Bet** → Create participant records, join betting action
5. **View Stats** → Real user statistics and balance tracking
6. **Sign Out** → Secure session termination

## 🚧 NEXT PHASE - ENHANCED FEATURES (Medium Priority)

### 1. MyBetsScreen Enhancements
**Status**: PENDING - Screen exists but needs filtering for user's bets

**Remaining Work**:
- Filter bets where user is creator or participant
- Add bet status filtering (active, completed, etc.)
- Show user's position and potential payouts

### 2. Bet Resolution System
**Status**: PENDING - Core for completing the betting cycle

**Remaining Work**:
- Implement bet resolution workflow
- Add evidence submission for disputes
- Calculate and distribute payouts
- Update user stats after bet completion

### 3. Enhanced Real-time Features
**Status**: PENDING - Build on existing subscriptions

**Remaining Work**:
- Real-time participant count updates
- Live bet activity notifications
- Instant balance updates after payouts

## 🔮 FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS (Lower Priority)

### 4. Small enhancements
- rework "my bets" screen to just be bets the user has signed up for.
- wire up the my bets stats to real stats
- move joinable bets to the live tab instead unless the user was invited to the bet.should only be active or ones that the user is being invited to join. 
- when joining, bets are defaulting to $10 and should reflect actual bet amounts from the bet itself
- balance appears to be hard coded or not refreshing on the header
- default bet creation is set at $1.00 and it should be formatted when the user inputs any changes
- scrolling doesnt appear to work on the mybets page

### 5. Friend and Friend Management
  - work with each other on the scope

### 5. Location Services Integration
- Location-based bet discovery
- Verify bet locations for local events
- **Dependencies**: `expo-location`

## 🔮 Backlog ENHANCEMENTS (Lowest Priority)

### 4. QR Code Functionality
- Add QR code generation for bet sharing
- QR code scanning to join bets quickly
- **Dependencies**: `expo-camera`, `expo-barcode-scanner`

### 6. Camera Integration for Evidence
- Photo evidence for bet resolution
- Image upload to AWS S3
- **Dependencies**: `expo-camera`, `expo-image-picker`

### 7. Advanced Trust Scoring System
- Reputation tracking
- Bet resolution verification
- Social trust metrics

## 🛠️ Technical Debt & Improvements

### Code Quality
- Add TypeScript strict mode
- Implement error boundaries
- Add unit tests for core functionality
- Set up ESLint/Prettier configuration

### Performance
- Implement FlatList virtualization for large bet lists
- Add image optimization and caching
- Optimize GraphQL queries with fragments

### Security
- Input validation on all forms
- Rate limiting for bet creation
- Secure file uploads

## 🚀 Deployment Preparation

### Android
- Update app.json with proper metadata
- Configure splash screen and app icons
- Set up EAS Build for Play Store
- Test on physical Android devices

### iOS (Future)
- Configure iOS-specific settings
- Test on iOS simulator/device
- Prepare for App Store submission

npm run ios

# Deploy backend changes
npx amplify push

# Generate GraphQL types
npx amplify codegen
```

## 📝 Key Design Decisions Made

1. **Native UI Over Web Components**: Full React Native implementation for better mobile performance
2. **AWS Amplify Gen2**: Modern serverless backend with GraphQL API
3. **Bottom Tab Navigation**: Industry-standard mobile navigation pattern
4. **Professional Color Scheme**: Dark theme with blue accents for betting app aesthetic
5. **Component-Based Architecture**: Reusable components for scalability

## 🐛 Known Issues Addressed ✅

1. ~~**Mock Data**: Several screens still use mock data instead of real GraphQL queries~~ - **RESOLVED**
2. ~~**Error Handling**: Need comprehensive error handling throughout app~~ - **IMPLEMENTED**
3. ~~**Loading States**: Some screens need loading indicators~~ - **ADDED**
4. **Form Validation**: Add comprehensive form validation - **PARTIAL** (basic validation added)
5. **Offline Support**: Consider offline-first functionality - **FUTURE ENHANCEMENT**

## 💡 Success Metrics to Track

- User engagement (daily active users)
- Bet completion rate
- Trust score accuracy
- App store ratings
- Revenue per user (if monetized)
