## üîß DEVELOPMENT SETUP

### **Key Commands**
```bash
npm start              # Start Expo development server
npm run android        # Run on Android device/emulator
npm run ios            # Run on iOS simulator
npm run typecheck      # Run TypeScript type checking
npx amplify push       # Deploy backend changes
npx amplify codegen    # Generate GraphQL types
```

### **Troubleshooting: Expo/Metro Not Starting**

If Expo or Metro bundler won't start or shows port conflicts, use these commands:

**Windows:**
```bash
# Find and kill processes on port 8081 (Metro bundler)
netstat -ano | findstr :8081
taskkill /PID <PID> /F

# Kill all Node processes
taskkill /F /IM node.exe

# Kill all Java processes (Android emulator/Gradle)
taskkill /F /IM java.exe

# Kill all Expo processes
taskkill /F /IM expo.exe

# Clear Metro cache and restart
npx expo start --clear
```

**macOS/Linux:**
```bash
# Find and kill processes on port 8081
lsof -ti:8081 | xargs kill -9

# Kill all Node processes
pkill -9 node

# Kill all Java processes
pkill -9 java

# Clear Metro cache and restart
npx expo start --clear
```

**Full Reset Procedure:**
```bash
# 1. Kill all processes
taskkill /F /IM node.exe
taskkill /F /IM java.exe

# 2. Clear all caches
npx expo start --clear

# 3. If still having issues, clear npm cache
npm cache clean --force

# 4. Delete node_modules and reinstall (last resort)
rm -rf node_modules
npm install
```

**Common Issues:**
- **Port 8081 in use**: Kill node.exe processes
- **Android emulator stuck**: Kill java.exe processes
- **Metro bundler cache issues**: Use `--clear` flag
- **TypeScript errors persisting**: Run `npx amplify codegen` to regenerate types

### **Current Development Status**
- **Main Branch**: `main` (stable, full account system complete)
- **Latest Features**: Account menu system, bet invitations, modal standards
- **Status**: Production-ready MVP with complete feature set
