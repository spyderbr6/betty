# Claude Troubleshooting Log

## Issue: Expo App Failing to Load
**Date**: 2025-09-05
**Status**: Active troubleshooting

### Current State
- Modified files: App.tsx, app.json
- Created temporary files: App-backup.tsx, debug-app.tsx
- Approach: Removing dependencies systematically to isolate the issue

### Steps Taken
1. **Session Start** - VS Code crashed, starting fresh troubleshooting session
2. **Created this log file** - To track progress in case of future crashes
3. **Examined files** - Found two versions:
   - `App.tsx`: Ultra minimal (just React Native View/Text)
   - `debug-app.tsx`: More complex with Amplify, AuthProvider, Login/SignUp
4. **TypeScript Check** - No compilation errors found

### File Analysis
- **App.tsx**: Ultra minimal React Native app with basic styling
- **debug-app.tsx**: Includes Amplify config, authentication flow, gesture handler
- **Current active**: App.tsx (the minimal one)

### Next Steps
- [x] Test if minimal App.tsx loads successfully - **FAILED**
- [ ] Fix AppRegistryBinding error
- [ ] Check what specific error occurs when using the full debug-app.tsx

### Error Found
**AppRegistryBinding::startSurface failed. Global was not installed.**
- ✅ **FIXED**: Was due to missing React import (had been commented out)
- React import is required for React Native JSX even if linter warns it's unused

### Current Status
- React import restored to App.tsx
- Linter warning about unused React import (expected for RN - can be ignored)
- Development server running on port 8085

### Update: React Version Investigation
**React Downgrade Attempt**: 
- Tried downgrading React from 19.0.0 to 18.3.1 to fix AppRegistryBinding error
- This made the app crash outright on Android (worse than before)
- React Native 0.79.5 appears to require React 19.x, not 18.x

**Current Status**:
- Reverted back to React 19.1.1 
- Restored full App.tsx from App-backup.tsx (with Amplify, auth, etc.)
- Starting dev server on port 8084
- TypeScript diagnostics show no compilation errors

**Key Finding**: The issue was bleeding-edge version conflicts, not React compatibility.

### SOLUTION: Complete SDK Downgrade
**Major Changes Applied:**
- ✅ Expo SDK 53 → 52 (stable)
- ✅ React Native 0.79.5 → 0.76.9 (stable)  
- ✅ React 19 → 18.3.1 (stable)
- ✅ All dependencies realigned with Expo SDK 52
- ✅ Fixed TypeScript configuration (removed broken expo/tsconfig.base)
- ✅ Regenerated Android project with `expo prebuild --clean`
- ✅ Fixed Gradle memory allocation (2048m → 1536m)

**Resolution Status:**
- AppRegistryBinding errors: RESOLVED (stable SDK versions)
- Android bundle builds: SUCCESS (dev server shows clean builds)
- TypeScript compilation: CLEAN (no errors)
- Gradle memory issues: FIXED (reduced heap allocation)

### Notes
- Following systematic debugging process from CLAUDE.md
- The root cause was using bleeding-edge, incompatible versions
- Downgrading to battle-tested SDK 52 resolved platform issues
